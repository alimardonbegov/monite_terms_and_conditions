            CONCLUSION AND SCOPE OF APPLICATION OF MONITE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
            <ol class="center__element-list">
              <li class="center__element-item">
                These General Terms and Conditions (“ <b>Monite T&Cs</b>“) apply to all services with all contents, features, functions, services and rules as software as a service (“
                <b>Monite Services</b>“, a service or software as a service, each a “ <b>Monite Service</b>“) provided within the scope of the comprehensive contractual relationship (“
                <b>Monite Contract</b>“), based on (i) this Monite T&Cs, (ii) one or more separate Commercial Agreements (together, the “ <b> Commercial Agreement </b>“), and/or (iii) the Data
                Processing Agreement of Monite (“ <b>DPA</b>“), between Monite GmbH (or its legal successors hereinafter referred to as “ <b>Monite</b>“) as software as a service provider and the
                business entity as user of the Monite Services and client of Monite (“ <b>Client</b>“) and, as the case may be, customers of the Client as users of the Monite Services (“
                <b>End Users</b>”) provided via Monite’s website, its subpages, its software programs, its tools, its workflows, its connectors, adapters or interfaces (including APIs) and/or any of
                its applications (together “ <b>Product</b>“).
              </li>
              <li class="center__element-item">
                The Monite Contract is concluded (i) in relation to Clients, by execution of the Commercial Agreement whereby the Monite T&Cs get accepted by the Client and (ii) in relation to End
                Users, by acceptance of the respective Monite T&Cs and, if applicable, the relevant Partner Agreement, by the End User in the onboarding pages or other areas of the Product. For the
                avoidance of doubt, any End Users that do not actively accept the Monite T&Cs and/or the Partner Agreement can solely make use of the Monite Services indirectly through the relevant
                Client without a direct contractual relationship with Monite and/or the relevant Partner. In case of a conflict between the Commercial Agreement and the Monite T&Cs, the Commercial
                Agreement shall prevail.
              </li>
              <li class="center__element-item">
                The use of the Product and the Monite Services provided by Monite is subject to these Monite T&Cs. For additionally provided services (“ <b>Partner Services</b>“) of other regulated
                and non-regulated third party providers (including, without limitation, payment service providers, each a “ <b>Partner</b>“) – if a separate contractual relationship of the Client
                and/or the End Users with the respective Partner is required – the terms of use and other contractual conditions separately agreed by the Client and/or the End Users (as applicable)
                with the respective Partner, including the General Terms and Conditions of these Partners (each a “ <b>Partner Agreement</b>“), shall apply. Monite keeps an up-to-date list of all
                Partners and their respective Partner Services (“ <b>Partner Services List</b>”). General Terms and Conditions of the Client are excluded in principle and will only become a part of
                the Monite Contract if Monite expressly consents and approves this in writing.

              <li class="center__element-item">
                Clients can only be businesses (Unternehmer) within the meaning of section 14 of the German Civil Code (“ <b>BGB</b>”). The Monite T&Cs do not apply to consumers in the sense of
                section 13 BGB. Further restrictions (e.g. regarding the legal form, the commercial register entry or the country of origin of the Client) may result from regulatory requirements
                and/or business policy considerations of Monite or its Partners.

                Agreement to which the Monite T&Cs apply in full as part of the Monite Contract. Monite owes to the Client only those Monite Services which are listed as Monite Services in the, at the
                relevant time, current Commercial Agreement. The list and description of the Monite Services in the Commercial Agreement is a final and definitive enumeration (<i

                interfaces (inter alia, so-called APIs), which are in any case provided towards the Client and/or End User (as applicable) by the relevant Partners. This also applies in cases where
                Monite offers the access to the respective Partner Service on the basis of hosted onboarding and payment flows as a technical service provider authorized by the respective Partner.

                Commercial Agreement and the Monite T&Cs. Monite’s performance of the Monite Services shall be made solely on a non-exclusive basis. Monite shall not be obliged to provide services
                other than within the scope of the Monite Services as agreed at the date of the Commercial Agreement or agreed thereafter in writing. No further rights of use are granted in relation
                to the Product or the Monite Services other than the License.

                The Client and/or the End User (as applicable) enters into its own contractual relationship with a Partner on the basis of a respective Partner Agreement if the Client and/or the End
                User (as applicable) wants to make use of the relevant Partner Services. The relevant Partner Services are not provided by Monite as part of the Monite Services (with the effect that
                any Partner Services do not form part of any Monite Service). Any Partner Agreement applies in parallel to and independent of the Monite Contract. The Client shall also comply with all
                obligations under any Partner Agreement.
              </li>
              <li class="center__element-item">
                The Client and/or the End User gets charged fees for Partner Services (as applicable) directly by the relevant Partner or by Monitee (for the account of the Partner). Details of such
                fees are stipulated in the Commercial Agreement and/or the relevant Partner Agreements.
              </li>
              <li class="center__element-item">
                Due to the fact that Monite acts only as a technical service provider on the basis of a cooperation agreement with the relevant Partners, Monite is bound by instructions of the
                relevant Partners, in particular to the extent that regulatory requirements must be fulfilled. This may apply, for example, under or in connection with the following circumstances:
                <ul class="par-ul">
                  <li class="par-li">blocking or restriction of use of the Monite Services; and</li>

                Coordination with the relevant Partners may take some time. In some cases, Monite may also not be legally entitled to provide the Client/End User with information on the reasons for or
                other details of the respective measures taken by a Partner under the respective Partner Agreement.
              </li>

                To the extent that the Product enables the Client/End User to access Partner Services, Monite assumes no responsibility for such third-party websites or applications or the content
                modified by the Partner Services and the Client/End User assumes exclusive responsibility for all related risks in connection with the access or use of such websites or applications
                and the third-party content or products in connection with the Partner Services.

              <li class="center__element-item">
                The use of the Monite Services is independent and unrestricted of the Partner Services. This means that it is still possible to make use of the Monite Services after the termination of
                a Partner Agreement, several Partner Agreements or all Partner Agreements.
              </li>
              <li class="center__element-item">
                For the conclusion of certain Partner Agreements with the Client/End User, the relevant Partner conducts a verification in accordance with regulatory and legal requirements (“<b>
                  Regulatory Check</b
                >“). In the course of the Regulatory Check, the relevant Partner verifies, among other things, the identity of the Client/End User, its ultimate beneficial owner and its legal
                representatives. For the Regulatory Check, the Client/End User shall provide further information and submit documents during the registration process of the relevant Partner.

              <li class="center__element-item">
                With regards to further Partner Services (not yet offered and only offered from a future date onwards), Monite will inform the Client/End User timely in an appropriate form about their
                content and any requirements to accept the general terms and conditions of the relevant Partner. Details of the Partner Services can be found in the respective Partner Agreements and
                the Partner Services List. The Client explicitly acknowledges that Partner Agreements are beyond Monite’s control.
