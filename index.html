              The Client and/or the End User (as applicable) enters into its own contractual relationship with a Partner on the basis of a respective Partner Agreement if the Client and/or the End

              Partner Services do not form part of any Monite Service). Any Partner Agreement applies in parallel to and independent of the Monite Contract. The Client shall also comply with all

            </li>
            <li class="center__element-item">
              Due to the fact that Monite acts only as a technical service provider on the basis of a cooperation agreement with the relevant Partners, Monite is bound by instructions of the relevant
              Partners, in particular to the extent that regulatory requirements must be fulfilled. This may apply, for example, under or in connection with the following circumstances:

              For the conclusion of certain Partner Agreements with the Client/End User, the relevant Partner conducts a verification in accordance with regulatory and legal requirements (“ Regulatory
              Check“). In the course of the Regulatory Check, the relevant Partner verifies, among other things, the identity of the Client/End User, its ultimate beneficial owner and its legal
              representatives. For the Regulatory Check, the Client/End User shall provide further information and submit documents during the registration process of the relevant Partner.
